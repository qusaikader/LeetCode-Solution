class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hashMap = {}
        for index,value in enumerate(nums):
            if target-value in hashMap:
                return [index,hashMap[target-value]] 
            else:
                hashMap[value] = index
                
The solution is done in O(N) time.
Other solution is bruteforce which takes O(N^2) time.
